		<p> I am Josue(Jozye) Merisier, an Afrikan native, born in Ayiti/Kiskeya (known as: Haiti).
		    I reside in Queens, NY. I am a US Army veteran. I possess two Associates degrees in IT & Network Administrator respectively.
		    Earlier this year, I have completed a Software Testing course with <a href="https://perscholas.org/" target="_blank">Per Scholas</a> in the Bronx.
		    I am currently taking the Web Development Immersive program with General Assembly in Manhattan, codenamed: <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank">WDI</a>, where I look to become a Full Stack Web Developer .
		    I had worked as a Home Health Aid, a Tutor, and a Desktop Support Specialist, among the few things I have done.
		    I am eager to complete my current training, so I will be able to partner up with any company that share my vision for accountability, efficiency, equity, and results.
		    I see the future as a field of roses and greens, with a bright horizon. Together, we certainly can!
